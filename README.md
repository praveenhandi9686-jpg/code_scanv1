# CodeScan — AI Code Reviewer & Bug Detection System
## Setup (Windows PowerShell)
    python -m venv venv; .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt; copy .env.example .env; python app.py
## Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt && cp .env.example .env && python app.py
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000. Set a real SECRET_KEY in `.env`.
## AI (optional)
Put `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_URL` in `.env` (server-side only). The endpoint must accept OpenAI-style chat-completions requests. Without them, static analysis still runs.
## Tests
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pytest -q
## Production
Use `FLASK_ENV=production`, a strong SECRET_KEY, PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` (+ psycopg2), HTTPS, `gunicorn "app:create_app()"`, and a shared rate-limit store (Redis) instead of the in-memory one.

## Suggested Code
After each review, CodeScan builds a corrected version of your code (automatic fixes, upgraded by the AI when configured). The AI version is only shown if static analysis rates it at least as good. A diff and before/after score are included; nothing overwrites your editor unless you click "Load into editor".
## Output
"Run original / Run suggested" executes Python, JavaScript, Bash, Ruby and PHP (if installed) and shows stdout/stderr; HTML shows a sandboxed preview. This is NOT a hardened sandbox, so it is off unless FLASK_ENV=development or ENABLE_CODE_EXECUTION=true. Never enable it on a public server.

## Analysis engines and accuracy
Syntax errors come from real parsers (Python `ast`, tree-sitter for JS/TS/Java/C/C++/C#/Go/PHP/Ruby/Rust/Bash/Kotlin/Swift, plus built-in CSS and HTML parsers), so they are essentially exact. Security/bug findings are rule-based and carry a Confirmed/Potential/Suggestion label; expect roughly 80-90% useful results, not perfection. SQL has no parser (rules only). If a tree-sitter package is missing, that language falls back to pattern rules; the review status line shows which engine was used. `tests/corpus.py` holds the clean/buggy samples that guard accuracy: add a failing sample there whenever you find a miss.

## Accounts, reports and settings
- **Login / register** with username or email and a password.
- **Reports** download as a PDF with scores, severity chart, findings, source listing and suggested code. **Import file** reads a source file in the browser (max 200 KB).
- **Profile** shows your account data and stats; **Settings** has profile, password, full history and account deletion.

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to GitHub (the repo root must contain `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `public/`, `templates/`).
2. Vercel > Add New > Project > import the repo (Framework preset: Flask / Other; leave build settings empty).
3. Create a database: Vercel > Storage > Create > Neon (Postgres) > Connect to this project. It adds `DATABASE_URL` / `POSTGRES_URL` automatically.
4. Project > Settings > Environment Variables, add: `SECRET_KEY` (a random 32+ character string, required), and optionally `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_URL`.
5. Deploy. Open `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/health` - it should return `{"status":"ok","success":true}`.

Notes: running code (Output section) is always disabled on Vercel for security. Rate limits are per serverless instance. Without `DATABASE_URL` the app uses a temporary SQLite file in /tmp, so accounts and history are lost between invocations.

## Deploy to Render
Easiest: Render Dashboard > New > **Blueprint** > select this repo (it reads `render.yaml`: web service + Postgres, `SECRET_KEY` generated automatically).
Manual setup instead: New > Web Service > Language **Python 3**; Build Command `pip install -r requirements.txt`; Start Command `gunicorn app:app --workers 1 --threads 4 --timeout 120 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`; Health Check Path `/api/health`; environment variables `FLASK_ENV=production`, `SECRET_KEY` (random 32+ chars) and `DATABASE_URL` (a Postgres URL). Python is pinned to 3.12 by `.python-version`.
Add `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_API_URL` under Environment to enable AI. Free plan: the service sleeps after 15 minutes idle (first request is slow) and free Postgres expires after 30 days; for permanent data put an external Postgres URL (Neon, Supabase) in `DATABASE_URL` and delete the `databases:` block.
